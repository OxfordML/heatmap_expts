JOINT REMOTE SENSING DAMAGE ASSESSMENT DATABASE

Haiti Earthquake 12 January 2010
In support to Post Disaster Needs Assessment and Recovery Framework (PDNA)
 



INTRODUCTION 

This readme document serves to introduce and describe the joint damage assessment datasets used to generate the Atlas of Building Damage Assessment. The database is a joint collaboration between the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT), European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC JRC) and the World Bank. 

Files available for download include Geographic Information System (GIS) data files (vector data) that can be used with an Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) compatible commercial GIS software (or with ESRI’s ArcReader utility) as well as with other commercial and open source GIS software that can read ESRI file formats.

Three download packages are available (see the section entitled “File Digital Contents” below for details).   

DISCLAIMER

This is a damage assessment based on satellite imagery and aerial photos. The work was carried out on a best effort basis within a strict time frame and should be used being aware of the resulting limitations. Omissions and class confusion may occur in the dataset and users are encouraged to send revised points and corrections to the joint team using the following e-mail: 
joint-assessment-haiti@unosat.org

An updated version of GIS data based on field validation will be issued once this information is available.

The depiction and use of boundaries, geographic names and related data used are not warranted to be error free nor do they imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations, European Commission or The World Bank.


METHODOLOGY 

Through the use of aerial photos provided by the World Bank (World Bank- ImageCat-RIT Remote Sensing Mission), Google and NOAA, as well as satellite imagery from GeoEye and Digitalglobe, detailed damage assessments of individual buildings have been conducted by comparing pre-earthquake satellite imagery to post Eearthquake satellite imagery and aerial photos. The spatial resolution (level of detail) for the satellite imagery used is approximately 50 cm while for the aerial photos it is approximately 15 cm. Image analysts at UNITAR/UNOSAT and EC JRC have through manual photo-interpretation categorized buildings into destroyed, severely damaged, moderately damaged and no visible damage. The damage to buildings and structures concerns damage that is visible from satellite and aerial imagery. Since satellite and aerial imagery generally provides an overhead viewpoint, lateral damage, and especially damage to the internal structures of buildings, is not detectable from the analysis. It is highly probable, that the damages currently identified in this assessment underestimate the actual building and infrastructure damages present on the ground.

Identification of individual buildings in Port-au-Prince and Delmas prior to the earthquake has benefited from the assistance of Swisstopo and the Remote Sensing Laboratories (RSL) of the University of Zurich. The World Bank has worked with a network of volunteer collaborators, GEO CAN (Global Earth Observation – Catastrophe Assessment Network), and with ImageCat,Inc. to perform damage assessment. This assessment also took place through manual photo-interpretation delineating the footprints (polygons) of destroyed and very heavy damaged buildings. The categorization of damage is based on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98) Five-level grading system. This data was integrated with the UNITAR/UNOSAT and EC JRC data for inclusion in this building damage atlas series as well as subsequent statistical analyses.

The work presented here comprises a comprehensive and joint GIS database of the three main operational remote sensing damage assessments carried out following the 12 January earthquake.

FILE DIGITAL CONTENTS

The digital data available for distribution consists of: 

1) Building Damage Assessment Geodatabase package that contains a feature dataset stored within an ESRI format file geodatabase (v. 9.3.1)

PDNA_HTI_2010_Atlas_of_Building_Damage_Assessment_v2_gdb.ZIP which contains:

PDNA_HTI_2010_Atlas_of_Building_Damage_Assessment_v2.gdb:
An ESRI file geodatabase with a feature dataset: 
 
- Damage_Analysis: point feature class representing the combined UNOSAT/JRC/WB building damage points with associated attribute fields.

2) Building Damage Assessment Shapefile package that contains a point shapefile exported from the file geodatabase. 


PDNA_HTI_2010_Atlas_of_Building_Damage_Assessment_v2_shp.ZIP which contains:

- PDNA_HTI_2010_Atlas_of_Building_Damage_Assessment_v2.shp: 
Point shapefile of Building Damage Assessment feature class exported from the geodatabase. 


3) Building Damage Assessment Atlas series (Adobe Portable Document Format) for the 11 most affected communes. For each main city listed below a separate atlas is produced. This includes an overview map of the atlas sheets, as well as individual sheets at a scale of 1:2,500 for A3 size hardcopy printouts.

If you have access to ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 or ArcGIS 9.2 with service pack 5 (SP5), download the Geodatabase package. 

If you rather have access to ArcView 3.x (or a GIS that can read shapefiles), download the Shapefile package. 

To download the Atlas series or parts of it, download the PDF file and open it from Adobe Reader 5.0 or later (free download from http://www.adobe.com).
